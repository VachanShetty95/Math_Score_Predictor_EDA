# End to End machine learning project
### Conducted exploratory data analysis to understand the relationship between various features and student grades in specific subjects.
### Preprocessed data, including cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
### Applied machine learning algorithms, including linear regression, catboost, XGboost etc., to build models for predicting student grades.
### Evaluated the performance of the models using metrics such as mean squared error and r2 squared. -Deployed the final model as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input student data and receive predicted grades. 
### Contributed to the full end-to-end implementation of the project, including development, testing, and deployment.
